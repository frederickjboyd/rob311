# rob311

Labs and final project for ROB311 (Artificial Intelligence) at the University of Toronto.

- Lab 1: State-Space Search
- Lab 2: Structured Problem Solving and Planning
- Lab 3: Decision Trees and Adversarial Games
- Lab 4: Markov Decision Processes

## Setup

1. Install Anaconda (Python 3)
2. Open Anaconda Prompt
3. Navigate to this repository's root and run `conda env create -f rob311.yml`.

## Final Project

The final project for this course explored reinforcement learning with the OpenAI Gym library. The goal was to build an agent to solve the [cart-pole task (v0)](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/). This agent was able to achieve a best average reward of over 4700, achieving a rank of **2nd place** in the class.

See the comments in [rl_agent.py](Final%20Project/rl_agent.py) for implementation details.
